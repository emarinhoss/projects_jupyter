    "In magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory the mode had a nominal real frequency and growth rate of $\\omega_R$, $\\gamma\\approx\\Omega$ (rotational frequency of the ion fluid). Adding finite-Larmor-radius 'FLR' effect, the mode exhibited a stability threshold for a particular ratio of $\\Omega/\\Omega_*$ ($*$ is the ion diamagnetic drift frequency).\n",
