    "The CR model functions as a generalized equation of state for the electronic energy modes. It is used to compute the populations of the excited levels through detailed kinetic relations for excitation and ionization, and reverse processes, allowing for non-Boltzmann distribution of bound electronic states. Rates are computed from collision cross sections of the associated processes under the assumption of a Maxwellian electron energy distribution function(EEDF).\n",

    "In the CR model, each electronic state of the atom is treated as a separate species. The time evolution of the speciesâ€™ number densities are determined by solving a set of rate equations, which includes all the relevant kinetic processes by means of collisional and radiative interactions. All the macroscopic rates are computed assuming a Maxwellian EEDF of the heavy particles or electrons."
