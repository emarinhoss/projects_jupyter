    "\n",
    "Each row, or record, of a table contains information about a single entity. For example, in a table representing employees, each row represents a single person. Each column, or field, of a table contains a single attribute for all rows in the table.

Querying is an essential skill for a data scientist, since the data you need for your analyses will often live in databases.\n",

    "Throughout this course, you'll be working with the **countries** database containing information about the most populous world cities as well as country-level economic data, population data, and geographic data.
