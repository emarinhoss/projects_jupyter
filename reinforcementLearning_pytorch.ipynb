    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent has to decide between two actions - moving the cart left or right - so that the pole attached to it stays upright. You can find an official leaderboard with various algorithms and visualizations at the [Gym website](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses an action, the environment transitions to a new state, and also returns a reward that indicates the consequences of the action. In this task, rewards are +1 for every incremental timestep and the environment terminates if the pole falls over too far or the cart moves more then 2.4 units away from center. This means better performing scenarios will run for longer duration, accumulating larger return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real values representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.). However, neural networks can solve the task purely by looking at the scene, so we’ll use a patch of the screen centered on the cart as an input. Because of this, our results aren’t directly comparable to the ones from the official leaderboard - our task is much harder. Unfortunately this does slow down the training, because we have to render all the frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, we will present the state as the difference between the current screen patch and the previous one. This will allow the agent to take the velocity of the pole into account from one image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**First, let’s import needed packages.**"

    "We’ll be using experience replay memory for training our DQN. It stores the transitions that the agent observes, allowing us to reuse this data later. By sampling from it randomly, the transitions that build up a batch are decorrelated. It has been shown that this greatly stabilizes and improves the DQN training procedure.\n",

    "### DQN algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Our environment is deterministic, so all equations presented here are also formulated deterministically for the sake of simplicity. In the reinforcement learning literature, they would also contain expectations over stochastic transitions in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim will be to train a policy that tries to maximize the discounted, cumulative reward $R_{t_0}=\\sum_{t=t0}^\\infty r_t$, where $R_{t_0}$ is also known as the return. The discount, $\\gamma$, should be a constant between 0 and 1 that ensures the sum converges. It makes rewards from the uncertain far future less important for our agent than the ones in the near future that it can be fairly confident about.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind Q-learning is that if we had a function $Q_∗:State\\times Action\\rightarrow\\mathcal{R}$, that could tell us what our return would be, if we were to take an action in a given state, then we could easily construct a policy that maximizes our rewards:\n",
    "$$\\pi^∗(s)=argmax_a Q^∗(s,a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we don’t know everything about the world, so we don’t have access to $Q_∗$. But, since neural networks are universal function approximators, we can simply create one and train it to resemble $Q_∗$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our training update rule, we’ll use a fact that every Q function for some policy obeys the Bellman equation:\n",
    "$$ Q^\\pi (s,a) = r + \\gamma Q^\\pi (s',\\pi(s')) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the two sides of the equality is known as the temporal difference error, $\\delta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\delta = Q(s, a) - (r + \\gamma \\max_a Q(s', a))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimise this error, we will use the [Huber loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss)The Huber loss acts like the mean squared error when the error is small, but like the mean absolute error when the error is large - this makes it more robust to outliers when the estimates of $Q$ are very noisy. We calculate this over a batch of transitions, $B$, sampled from the replay memory:\n",
    "\n",

    "Here, you can find an **optimize_model** function that performs a single step of the optimization. It first samples a batch, concatenates all the tensors into a single one, computes $Q(s_t,a_t)$ and $V(s_{t+1})=max_aQ(s_{t+1},a)$, and combines them into our loss. By defition we set $V(s)=0$ if s is a terminal state. We also use a target network to compute $V(s_{t+1})$ for added stability. The target network has its weights kept frozen most of the time, but is updated with the policy network's weights every so often. This is usually a set number of steps but we shall use episodes for simplicity."
